Prior to scheduling an appointment for Designated Provider Services, please carefully review (a) the price information, and (b) all of the products and services that are included and excluded in each Designated Provider Service. Healthcare Providers are required to provide the applicable Designated Provider Service at or below the price indicated at the time of scheduling (“Designated Price”), unless you separately agree otherwise. Services in addition to or different from Designated Provider Services may be available, offered or rendered by Healthcare Providers. You and your Healthcare Providers are responsible for agreeing to any additional or different services. WE ARE NOT RESPONSIBLE FOR YOUR OR ANY HEALTHCARE PROVIDER’S FAILURE TO AGREE TO ANY ADDITIONAL OR DIFFERENT SERVICES.

While we endeavor to use reasonable efforts to validate the Insurance Content (as defined in the Terms of Use) (for example, your copayment obligation), we make no guarantees and disclaim all warranties that the Insurance Content is correct since the Insurance Content is provided by the insurance provider or via a third-party clearinghouse. Please also keep in mind that (a) the Insurance Content is constantly being updated (for example, to reflect amounts you may have paid earlier towards your deductible), (b) you are likely to receive an explanation of benefits (or similar document) from you insurance company after you receive your Healthcare Provider’s services, and (c) you may owe your Healthcare Provider more than the amount you paid through the Insurance Payment Services.

(b) you remain responsible for paying all amounts required by law and/or contract (e.g., health plan agreement), including all cost-sharing obligations (such as, but not limited to, copayments, deductibles and other coinsurance obligations);

<br> (c) QureNet may process your payment, and may do so in collaboration with our payment processing partner;
<br> (d) QureNet is not responsible for any charges incurred for any products or services provided by Healthcare Provider, including any Designated Provider Service;

You further acknowledge and agree that: neither QureNet nor our payment processing partner will be responsible if either we or our payment processing partner are unable to complete a transaction for any reason, including but not limited to:
<br> (A) if you have not provided us with accurate, current and complete payment information;
<br> (B) if you do not have sufficient available funds or available credit to complete the transaction;
<br> (C) if you do not have an active payment card, or if we are unable to confirm your payment card information or your identity;
<br> (D) if your account with us, your account with our payment processing partner, your access to the Services, or your access to our payment processing partner’s services has been terminated or suspended for any reason;
<br> (E) if we or our payment processing partner have reason to believe that the requested transaction is unauthorized; or
