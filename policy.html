                                    Under a federal law called the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act
                                    (“HIPAA”), some demographic, health and/or health-related information that QureNet
                                    collects as part of providing the Services may be considered “protected health
                                    information” or “PHI.” Specifically, when QureNet receives identifiable information
                                    about you from or on behalf of your Healthcare Providers, this information is
                                    considered PHI.
                                    <br> <br>
                                    HIPAA provides specific protections for the privacy and security of PHI and
                                    restricts how PHI is used and disclosed. QureNet may only use and disclose your PHI
                                    in the ways permitted by your Healthcare Provider(s). In addition, you may be asked
                                    to e-sign the QureNet authorization (the “QureNet Authorization”). Your decision to
                                    e-sign the QureNet Authorization is entirely voluntary. If you choose to e-sign the
                                    QureNet Authorization, you agree that QureNet may use and disclose your PHI in the
                                    same way it uses and discloses your Personal Information that is not PHI. These uses
                                    and disclosures are described in this Privacy Policy. To the extent any provision in
                                    the QureNet Authorization is inconsistent with this Privacy Policy or other
                                    provisions of the Agreement, then the provision in the QureNet Authorization only
                                    controls with respect to your PHI. If you do not e-sign the QureNet Authorization,
                                    then your Personal Information that is not PHI is governed by this Privacy Policy
                                    and your Personal Information that is PHI is used and disclosed only as permitted by
                                    your Healthcare Provider(s).

                            We collect information (including Personal Information and Traffic Data) when you use and

                            collection include:
                            <br> When you use the Services’ interactive tools and services, such as searching for
                            Healthcare Providers, searching for available appointments with Healthcare Providers and
                            completing medical history forms (“Medical History Forms”) prior to Healthcare Provider
                            appointments;

                            <br> We may use tools outlined below in order to provide our Services to, advertise to, and
                            to
                            <br> better understand users.
                            <br> Cookies: “Cookies” are small computer files transferred to your computing device that
                            <br> contain information such as user ID, user preferences, lists of pages visited and
                            activities
                            <br> conducted while using the Services. We use cookies to improve or tailor the
                            <br> Services, customize advertisements by tracking navigation habits, measuring
                            performance, and
                            <br> storing authentication status so re-entering credentials is not required, customize
                            user
                            <br> experiences with the Services, and for analytics and fraud prevention. For more
                            information
                            <br> on cookies, including how to control your cookie settings and preferences, visit
                            <br> http://www.allaboutcookies.org.
                            <br> Some cookies are placed by a third party on your device and provide information to us
                            <br> and third parties about your browsing habits (such as your visits to our Services, the
                            pages
                            <br> you have visited, and the links and advertisements you have clicked). These cookies can
                            be
                            <br> used to determine whether certain third party services are being used, to identify your
                            <br> interests, and to serve advertisements relevant to you. We do not control third party
                            <br> cookies.
                            <br> Web Beacons: “Web Beacons” (a.k.a. clear GIFs or pixel tags) are tiny graphic image
                            files
                            <br> embedded in a web page or email that may be used to collect information about the use
                            of our
                            <br> Services, the websites of selected advertisers and the emails, special promotions or
                            <br> newsletters that we send. The information collected by Web Beacons allows us to analyze
                            how
                            <br> many people are using the Services, using selected publishers’ websites or opening
                            emails,
                            <br> and for what purpose, and also allows us to enhance our interest-based advertising
                            <br> (discussed further below).
                            <br> Web Service Analytics: We may use third-party analytics services in connection with the
                            <br> Services, including, for example, to register mouse clicks, mouse movements, scrolling
                            <br> activity and text typed into the Site. We use the information collected from these
                            services
                            <br> to help make the Services easier to use and as otherwise set forth in Section 5 (How We
                            Use
                            <br> Your Information). These analytics services generally do not collect Personal
                            Information
                            <br> unless you voluntarily provide it and generally do not track your browsing habits
                            across web
                            <br> services that do not use their services.
                            <br> Mobile Device Identifiers: As with other Tracking Tools, mobile device identifiers help
                            <br> QureNet learn more about our users’ demographics and internet behaviors in order to
                            <br> personalize and improve the Services. Mobile device identifiers are data stored on
                            mobile
                            <br> devices that may track mobile device and data and activities occurring on and through
                            it, as
                            <br> well as the applications installed on it. Mobile device identifiers enable collection
                            of
                            <br> Personal Information (such as media access control, address and location) and Traffic
                            <br> Data.
                            <br> 4.2. Behavioral Advertising
                            <br> We may use a type of advertising commonly known as interest-based or online behavioral
                            <br> advertising. This means that some of our partners use Tracking Tools, such as cookies,
                            pixel
                            <br> tags, and web beacons, to collect information about a user’s online activities to
                            display
                            <br> QureNet ads to the user based on the user’s interests (“Behavioral Advertising”). Such
                            <br> partners may include third-party service providers, advertisers, advertising networks
                            or
                            <br> platforms, traffic measurement service providers, marketing analytics service
                            providers, and
                            <br> other third party service providers (collectively, “Advertising Service Providers”).
                            Other
                            <br> Tracking Tools used by our partners may collect
                            <br> information when you use the Services, such as IP address, mobile device ID, operating
                            <br> system, browser, web page interactions, geographic location and demographic
                            information,
                            <br> such as gender and age range. These Tracking Tools help QureNet learn more about our
                            users’
                            <br> demographics and internet behaviors.

                            4.3. Options for Opting out of Cookies and Mobile Device Identifiers
                            <br>
                            Some web browsers allow you to reject cookies or to alert you when a Cookie is placed on
                            <br>
                            your computer, tablet or mobile device. You may be able to reject mobile device identifiers
                            <br>
                            by activating the appropriate setting on your mobile device. Although you are not required
                            <br>
                            to accept QureNet’s cookies or mobile device identifiers, if you block or reject them, you
                            <br>
                            may not have access to all features available through the Services.
                            <br>
                            You may opt out of receiving certain cookies and certain trackers by visiting the Network
                            <br>
                            Advertising Initiative (NAI) opt out page or the Digital Advertising Alliance (DAA) consumer

                            <br>
                            computing device. When you use these opt-out features, an “opt-out” Cookie will be placed on
                            <br>
                            your computer, tablet or mobile computing device indicating that you do not want to receive
                            <br>
                            interest-based advertising from NAI or DAA member companies. If you delete cookies on your
                            <br>
                            computer, tablet or mobile computing device, you may need to opt out again. For information
                            <br>
                            about how to opt out of interest-based advertising on mobile devices, please visit

                            <br>
                            You will need to opt out of each browser and device for which you desire to apply these
                            <br>
                            opt-out features.
                            <br>
                            Even after opting out of Behavioral Advertising, you may still see QureNet advertisements
                            <br>
                            that are not interest-based (i.e., not targeted toward you). Also, opting out does not mean
                            <br>
                            that QureNet is no longer using Tracking Tools — QureNet still may collect information about
                            <br>
                            your use of the Services even after you have opted out of Behavioral Advertising and may
                            <br>
                            <br> still serve advertisements to you via the Services based on information it collects via
                            the
                            <br> Services.

                            <br> This Privacy Policy does not cover the use of cookies and other Tracking Tools by any
                            <br> third
                            <br> parties, and we aren’t responsible for their privacy policies and practices. Please be
                            aware
                            <br> that some cookies placed by third parties can continue to track your activities online
                            even
                            <br> after you have left our Services.

                            <br> 4.4. How QureNet Responds to Browser “Do Not Track” (DNT) Signals
                            <br> Some web browsers (including Safari, Internet Explorer, Firefox and Chrome) incorporate
                            a
                            <br> “Do Not Track” (DNT) or similar feature that signals to web services that a visitor
                            does not
                            <br> want to have his/her online activity and behavior tracked. If a web service operator
                            elects
                            <br> to respond to a particular DNT signal, the web service operator may refrain from
                            collecting
                            <br> certain Personal Information about the browser’s user. Not all browsers offer a DNT
                            option

                            <br> In certain circumstances, and in order to perform the Services, we may share certain

                            with
                            <br> whom you choose to schedule through the Services. For example, if you complete a

                            <br> History Form using the Services in advance of an appointment and elect to share it with

                            share
                            <br> your Personal Information with your Healthcare Providers to enable them to refer you to
                            and
                            <br> make appointments with other Healthcare Providers on your behalf or to perform analyses
                            on

                            facilitate
                            <br> access to health information to improve the safety, quality, and efficiency of

                            <br> We do not sell email addresses to third parties. We may share your Personal Information

                            <br> We may share your Personal Information and/or Traffic Data with our partners who
                            perform
                            <br> operational services (such as hosting, billing, fulfillment, data storage, security,

                            <br> services, features or functionality available to our users.
                            <br> Cross Device Matching: To determine if users have interacted with content across
                            multiple
                            <br> devices and to match such devices, we work with partners who analyze device activity
                            data
                            <br> and/or rely on your information (including demographic, geographic and interest-based
                            data).
                            <br> To supplement this analysis, we also provide de-identified data to these partners.
                            Based on
                            <br> this data, we may then display targeted advertisements across devices that we believe
                            are
                            <br> associated or use this data to further analyze usage of Services across devices.
                            <br> We may share your Personal Information with the insurance provider you identify to us
                            (and
                            <br> do so via our partners) to determine eligibility and cost-sharing obligations, or
                            otherwise
                            <br> obtain benefit plan and other insurance-related information on your behalf.
                            <br> Business Transfers: We may transfer your Personal Information to another company in
                            <br> connection with a proposed merger, sale, acquisition or other change of ownership or
                            control
                            <br> by or of QureNet (whether in whole or in part). Should one of these events occur, we
                            will
                            <br> make reasonable efforts to notify you before your information becomes subject to

                            <br> any other information we collect about you if we determine in good faith that such
                            <br> disclosure is needed to: (1) comply with or fulfill our obligations under applicable
                            law,
                            <br> regulation, court order or other legal process; (2) protect the rights, property or

                            <br> of you, QureNet or another party; (3) enforce the Agreement or other agreements with
                            you; or
                            <br> (4) respond to claims that any posting or other content violates third-party rights.
                            <br> Other Information: We may disclose information that is neither Personal Information nor
                            PHI
